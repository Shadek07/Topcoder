try to visit as many new nodes as possible to get new treaures.

stop when you visit the same set of nodes you visited before. The way you can check if you visited a node before is: current node has same number of treasures and numPaths that you had before. There is also a chance that the next node you visit is a brand new node although it has same treasure count and pathcount of any existing node. You can use a probability to determine if it is new or old node. This probability value could be set based on treasureValue and stepCost.

Try to always expand those nodes that have maximum out-degrees.

Whenever you land on a chamber/node, get maximum number of treasures that are allowed.

Maintain a shortest path (with order to visit) for every pair of nodes so that you can backtrack to the node quickly you wanna visit.

From a chamber, choose the edge that was chosen least number of times in the past. Use a probability distribution.
